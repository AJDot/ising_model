# Ising Model

This is a straight-forward physics/programming exercise. The two-dimensional Ising model is one of the simplest Monte Carlo simulations out there. The Ising Model is use to determine the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material. A description of some of the physics and the algorithm can be found below the simulation.

### (My) Background
As a physics graduate student I took a course called Statistical Mechanics. This branch of physics explores modeling physical phenomena using statistic concepts. The Ising model is one example where statistical mechanics lends it's help. We introduce some basic concepts of physics we wish to test; in this case it's magnetic susceptibility and some others. Run the simulation and see if the result agree with real measurable data. With enough verification the model becomes credible and predictions may be made about similar scenarios. Perhaps the model is trustworthy for a particular material or for a particular lattice structure; a model may be adapted to a new material or structure to give the initial predictions/estimates for something that has yet to be determined.

Anyway, in my statistical mechanics course we were tasked with modeling physic concepts using Monte Carlo simulations. My main tool at the time was a high-level mathematical program called *Mathematica*. One of the concepts I chose to model was the 2D Ising model. Others included simulated annealing (SA) and diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) in both two and three dimensions.

Now that I am developing my programming skills I thought I would try my hand at it in JavaScript. I had lost to original *Mathematica* program so this JavaScript implementation was started from scratch.

My introductory physics may be a bit rusty but I think it turned out well. Enjoy.
